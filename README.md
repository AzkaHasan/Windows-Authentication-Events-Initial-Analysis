# Windows-Authentication-Events-Initial-Analysis
# Windows Log Analysis Lab

## Overview
This repository documents hands-on analysis of Windows Security Event Logs with a focus on authentication behavior and threat detection fundamentals.

The goal is to understand how user actions generate security events and how these logs can be used to detect malicious activity.

## Environment
- Windows 10 / Windows Server (local or VM)
- Native Windows Event Viewer
- Security Event Log enabled

## Scope
Current analysis focuses on:
- User logon and logoff activity
- Authentication-related Security Event IDs
- Event patterns generated by common user actions

## Key Event IDs Observed
| Event ID | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 4624 | Successful logon |
| 4625 | Failed logon |
| 4634 | Logoff |
| 4648 | Logon using explicit credentials |
| 4672 | Special privileges assigned |

## Analyst Observations
- A single login action generates multiple Security events.
- Event IDs vary based on logon type and system state.
- Reliable detection should be based on event sequences and context rather than single events.
- Windows does not log the entered password for failed authentication attempts.
- Instead, Event ID 4625 provides metadata such as target account, logon type, and failure status, which is sufficient for detecting unauthorized access patterns.

## Next Steps
- Install Sysmon for enhanced telemetry
- Forward logs to a SIEM
- Develop basic detection queries
